# InnoCalendar
A service extracting elective course information from Google Docs to Google Calendar for individual course selection.

## Problem
Elective courses schedule is available in Google Docs, and the schedule changes. It is hard to track changes. In the current situation it is required to open Google Docs every day in order to see updates. However, there are no notifications at all.

## Summary
Addressing the above stated problem, we assume that it will be comfortable to have calendar which is synchronised with this Google Docs via provided link at least once a day. The system benefits for all masters who wants to do homework on time and be aware of schedule changes.

## Statement of need
As probably everybody already faced the problem of copying all the calendar information from Google Docs, in special regards to the elective courses, can be a tedious and time consuming - yet unpleasant task. In order to get rid of this task in the future, not only for us, but also for future students at IU, we propose a small system capable of doing this work for us. The basic idea is that a user can enter ones courses and system updates these to some calendar in some temporal distance - which is yet to be defined. 

## Prior research
For implementation, there are two known ways to achieve this goal, both involving a system account on Google. One can either create a new calendar for every student and share a link where all the information will be stored in, or the user has to share a calendar with the system account in order to give write access.
